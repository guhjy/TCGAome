\alias{get_binary_similarity}
\title{get_binary_similarity()}
\usage{
get_binary_similarity(x, term1, term2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The GeneAnnotations class on which the method will run.}

\item{term1}{The first term on which to calculate the functional similarity.}

\item{term2}{The second term on which to calculate the functional similarity.}
}
\value{
The binary functional similarity between term1 and term2
}
\description{
Function that gets the binary functional similarity between two terms. That is
a measure of the shared terms in the annotations resources.
}
\examples{
kegg <- TCGAome::load_kegg()
random_kegg_term1 = kegg@term2gene$Term[runif(1, max = length(kegg@term2gene$Term))]
random_kegg_term2 = kegg@term2gene$Term[runif(1, max = length(kegg@term2gene$Term))]
get_binary_similarity(kegg, random_kegg_term1, random_kegg_term2)
}
