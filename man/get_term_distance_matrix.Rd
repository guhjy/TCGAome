\usage{
get_term_distance_matrix(x, distance_measure, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The GeneAnnotations class on which the method will run.}

\item{distance_measure}{The binary distance method (one of UI, binary,
bray-curtis, cosine)}

\item{term1}{The first term on which to calculate the functional similarity.}

\item{term2}{The second term on which to calculate the functional similarity.}

\item{terms_subset}{A subset of terms on which to calculate the distance matrix}
}
\value{
The distance matrix for the subset if provided or for all the terms
otherwise
}
\description{
Function that returns the distance matrix between all the terms.
}
\examples{
kegg <- TCGAome::load_kegg()
get_term_distance_matrix(kegg, "cosine")
}
